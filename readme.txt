Idea:

People at Code university share their favorite places, write a short description and can see the places recommended by others.
Especially helpful if you are new in a city.
Later on it should be possible to have a map with filters / certain groups but for now it is probably too difficult
and time consuming to implement that.
Also we are only focusing on the surroundings of Code University in Berlin for the start.
People can recommend their favourite cafes and say when they can be found there (each morning around 8 f.e.)
, they can announce that they love a vegan restaurant just around the corner where they eat each Tuesday and Thursday around 12,
student dog owners indicate the best dog walk arount the university and others can drum up their fellow students for an
improvised stand-up-comedy evening in a park or a very special concert you shouldn't miss next Saturday. It is a map that
helps people to discover places and to meet people they know from university in different locations to develop a network of
shared interests and socialize.

What should be working:

The website should show the map centered on Berlin.
The user should be able to create markers by double clicking anywhere on the map.
The user should be able to click on any marker on the map and access the information stored in the marker.
The user should be able to rightclick and create marker with a different symbol then on click.
The marker should clickCount++ each time clicked.
The user should be able to write something in the marker.
Set some permanent marker in different color.
Set labels for some of them f.e. B for Bar, P for Park, C for Cafe, F for Food.
